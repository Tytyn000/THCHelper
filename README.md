This is a basic damage calculator for the game "Honkai Star Rail".
It contains only the basic things for calculate dmg. It is not 100% accurate and the damage between this software and in game may not be the same.
This software can fail because it was made in 7 days and the calculator in even less time.
This software is not very advanced the only things it can do is calculate damage with the Damage Formula.
I'm not affiliated with Mihoyo/Hoyoverse. The names of the characters and enemies present, as well as the damage formula do not belong to me. 
Thanks to https://www.prydwen.gg and the people who helped me with their explanations of the damage formula.
If you using this software I hope you enjoy it and you find it useful.
